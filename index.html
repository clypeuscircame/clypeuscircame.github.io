<p>
The metaphor of a shield is the focus of this study, a remarkably effective metaphor for illustrating the relationship of a god to his worshippers in terms of the basic aspects of their environment. The simple explanation of this is that the shield functioned as a concrete boundary between life and death in the hand-to-hand combat Of ancient rimes. Few metaphors for a god compare With the ability of the "shield metaphor" to clarify the thought of one's own god as a determining existential boundary between man's capability to live and develop in security and the unknown destructive forces of the world around us. 
<p>
It is obvious that the shield metaphor is a metaphor for protection, but it functions primarily as a religious relational metaphor. To live in a relationship with a god who is viewed as a "shield" is to live in a relationship to someone who is expected to guarantee one's own continued existence. When someone speaks to his god and says "my shield," a relationship has been established; an acceptance of a god's protection has been expressed and a dependency on this god has been confessed.
<p>

The fact that no two people are alike means that we never completely understand a metaphor in the same way. So a metaphorical expression is always an intensely personal meeting between the interpreter and the meaning of the metaphor. Because of this, the relation metaphors used to depict a person's deepest relationship to his god is one of the most deeply personal expressions in religious language to describe the presence of god. With this in mind, a study of the shield metaphor seems highly motivated.
